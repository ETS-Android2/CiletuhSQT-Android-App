This project will be far from perfect but this will be a milestone for all of us that participated
in this fellowship program, and this has been a pretty long ride, just hoping all the experiences and
education we got will always be useful for us. Thank you very much for ESRI Indonesia for giving us a
chance to be in the program, joining the MOOC Program, and patiently mentoring us through out the entire program.
